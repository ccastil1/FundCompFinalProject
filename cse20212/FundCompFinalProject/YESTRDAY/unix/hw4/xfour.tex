\begin{itemize}
	\item The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Althought not the
	largest natural satellite in the Solar System, among the satellites
	of major planets it is the largest relative to the size
	of the object it orbits (its primary).

	\item Phobos is the larger and closer of the two natural
	satellites of Mars. Both moons were discovered in 1877.
\end{itemize}
