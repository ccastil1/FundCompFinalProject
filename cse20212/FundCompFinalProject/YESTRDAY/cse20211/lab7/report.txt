				Lab 7 Part 2
	The purpose of this program was to utilize file pointers and two-dimensional arrays. The user would first be prompted to enter a text file. Then the user would be 
given five different options. These options were: display all the current sayings in the text file, add a new saying to the file, display a list of all the sayings with a 
specified search word, save the text file as a new file, and quit the program. The user simply entered the number of the desired option and followed the program's prompts.
	From the programer's perspective, the program used a switch case setup for each option. A two dimensional character array was established for the text file. First, 
the program established file pointers to enable the opening, reading, and editng of the text file. Then, the program used a while loop to scan each character of the text 
file. This was used in the needed cases along with the fgets and fgetc functions to display and edit the text file. The program runs in a while loop such that the menu of 
options is displayed after each output, so that the user can continue using the program until he decides to quit by pressing "5".
