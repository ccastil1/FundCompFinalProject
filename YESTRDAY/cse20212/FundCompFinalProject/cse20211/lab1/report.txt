	The purpose of the program is to calculate the distance an object travels using the user inputs 
of initial velocity, acceleration, and time of the objectâ€™s journey. This calculation is preformed by 
using the kinematic equation, distance = vt + 0.5at^2.
	The program first declares five float variables. The variables were declared as float 
because the inputs are not limited to integer values. These variables are initial velocity, 
acceleration, time, distance1, distance2, and totaldistance. The program uses the printf 
function to ask the user to input the initial velocity, acceleration, and time. Then, uses 
the scanf function to assign those values to their corresponding variables. The program then calculates 
distance1 as the first part of the kinematic equation, vt. Then, distance2 is calculated as 
the second part, 0.5at^2. The variable totaldistance is then calculated by adding distance1 and 
distance2. Finally, the printf function is used to display to the user the distance travelled by the object.
	Verifying that the program always produces correct results would require running the program 
with all possible inputs. I did not do this because there are infinite possibilies, but I did run the 
program with multiple values, including integers and non-integers. Each time, the program ran 
correctly.
